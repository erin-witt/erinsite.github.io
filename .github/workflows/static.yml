## An Open Letter to the Mayor of NYC

**Dear Mayor Adams,**

I am writing to you to express concern about the number of vehicle collisions that occur in our city every year and why they are happening. I heard you were recently pardoned which means you will now hopefully have time to read this letter. In this web page, I will share my findings about vehicle collisions.

# I would like to draw your attention to:

- The main causes of crashes  
- The most common types of vehicles involved in them  
- The year that had the highest number of collisions  

For more information, please visit [Hunter College's Website](https://hunter.cuny.edu/).

Here is an interactive map showing vehicle collisions in NYC.

##Data Information 

This data comes from NYC's open data initiative to make information more accessible to the public. The data is collected by NYPD officers out on the field of each collision. The largest problem with the data currently is that a lot of the entires contains misspellings or wrongly entered types of vehicles. I have cleaned off some of the data from a few years to learn more about collisions in NYC.
